<!-- Summary: I examine whether mispricing drives investors to consume accounting information. I find that mutual fund flow-induced mispricing increases the consumption of accounting information, especially among sophisticated investors. In addition, I find that information consumption following mutual fund fire sales predicts both the extent to which prices return to pre-fire sale levels as well as the speed of return reversals. These findings suggest that mispricing increases the demand for fundamental information contained in accounting reports and highlight the role of accounting information in the path of price discovery for mispriced firms. -->

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
