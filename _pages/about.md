My name is Ruoxi and I'm a fifth-year math PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Nankai University and master's degree from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

My research focuses on algebraic geometry, especially motivic classes of moduli stacks. I am currently interested in Serre polynomials of character varieties and motives of the moduli space of Higgs bundles on a curve.

TRIVIA: there are at least two more Ruoxis working in algebraic geometry:
