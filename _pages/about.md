My name is Ruoxi and I'm a fifth-year math PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh, working under <a href="https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/roman-fedorov"> Dr. Roman Fedorov</a>. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Nankai University and master's degree from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

My research focuses on algebraic geometry, especially motivic classes of moduli stacks. I am currently interested in Serre polynomials of character varieties.

TRIVIA. There are at least two more Ruoxis working in algebraic geometry:
