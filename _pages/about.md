My name is Ruoxi and I'm a fourth-year math PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Nankai University and master's degree from UIUC.

My research focuses on algebraic geometry, especially Fourier-Mukai transform and moduli stack of generalized line bundles on degenerate elliptic curve.
